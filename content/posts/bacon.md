My bacon's journey

<!--more-->

This is the journey of my bacon.

It all starts at the local butcher:

It can be a bit hit and miss with the size of the pork belly they have in stock, this time however it was stellar pork.

When I get home, it's time to remove the skin:

Once the skin has been removed (don't throw it out, chicharones can be made), we move over to making the spice/brine mix:
* 1 g of curing salt (prague 01) per 1kg of meat.
* 250 g of Light Brown Sugar
* 250 g of Fine Kosher Salt
* Add crushed pepper until you get your desired amount.

Stir it well to make sure there is a equal distribution of mix.

Now it's time to put them into the bags for the 7 days of rest.
How that is done you put the pork belly into the bag, smear on a thin coat your binder (in my case it's Maple Syrup).
Then coat both sides liberally with the mix to ensure that every part of the pork belly is covered.

The result should be looking something like the picture below:

Now comes the part where you need to daily flip the bag over to ensure that the brine penetrates properly.
